Hardware Notes:

System is based on the PIC32MX340F512 development board from sparkfun.

On My board I've added LED's L0-L1-L2-L3 that are used to indicate when the write process starts, and when each block of 8MB has been written.

The SD card socket is soldered on to the prototyping area to use SPI-2
	I used one of these card holders http://www.sparkfun.com/products/136
	But these will probably be easier to use http://www.sparkfun.com/products/204



Software Notes:

The code does the following:
	-initializes the disk
	-mounts the filesystem
	-Opens/creates if absent a file called 'fileset.dex'
	-1 byte is read from fileset.dex
		-if the file is empty a zero is written to it
		-otherwise the value is incremented and written back
	-fileset.dex is closed
	-based on the value of the byte a data file is created
	-The code then proceeds to write 24 MB of data to the new data file
		-ever 8MB an LED is turned on to notify the user
	-the data file is closed
	-the file system is unmounted


My code does NOT implement the card detect or write protect functionality.

Basically I have to have the card in when I release from reset or bad things will happen ;)
